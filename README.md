## Business Statistics

**Course Overview:**
Business Statistics at AUT covers fundamental statistical techniques with a strong emphasis on business and economic applications. The course includes topics such as data summary techniques, probability theory, probability distributions, sampling distributions, estimation, and regression analysis. Students gain skills in graphical and numerical data analysis, which are critical for interpreting and making data-driven decisions in business contexts.

**Mentoring Role:**
As the course instructor and mentor, I guide students through real-world applications of statistical concepts using projects and case studies. My mentorship focuses on enhancing analytical skills through problem-solving activities, encouraging teamwork in group discussions, and developing computer skills using tools like Excel for statistical analysis. By providing practical examples and personalized feedback, I help students connect the statistical theory to real-life business problems.
