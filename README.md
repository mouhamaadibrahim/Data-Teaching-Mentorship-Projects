# Data-Teaching-Mentorship-Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Teaching and Mentorship Projects at the **American University of Technology (AUT)**! This repository showcases a collection of projects, dashboards, reports, and teaching materials from my work as a university instructor and mentor. As an educator, I guide students through complex data analysis projects, help them develop practical skills, and support their growth into capable data professionals.

## Mentorship Highlights
Throughout my teaching career, I have elevated student skills and fostered academic success through targeted guidance and hands-on learning experiences. Here are some key achievements:
- **Elevated communication, analytical, and visualization skills by 50%** through mentoring data analysis projects in business, transport, and management, utilizing Excel pivot tables to produce 7 impactful dashboards and reports.
- **Boosted student engagement by 30%** with real-world SQL exercises in Management Information Systems, achieving a 90%+ pass rate.
- **Propelled 45% of students scoring 85%+ in Probability & Statistics** by integrating data analysis methodologies, leading to an 89% pass rate.
- **Facilitated 70%+ achievement among 50% of students** in data science-related courses like Linear Algebra and Discrete Math, supporting algorithm development and problem-solving, with over 5 students securing programming jobs.
- **Achieved 50% of students earning 80%+ in Calculus III** by incorporating various analytical techniques, including data modeling like least squares regression, resulting in a 94% pass rate.
- **Attained 40% of students scoring 75%+ in Calculus & Applied Math for Business** by incorporating real-world statistical analysis problems, contributing to an 85% pass rate.

## Impact of Teaching and Mentorship
My mentorship has significantly impacted students' academic journeys, empowering them to excel in data-related courses and secure opportunities in their careers. By integrating practical exercises and real-world data analysis scenarios, I have enhanced studentsâ€™ problem-solving and technical skills, preparing them for industry demands.

## Technical Skills Applied
In my teaching and mentorship, I leverage a diverse set of tools and methodologies to drive student success:
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Excel, with an overview of Power BI.
- **Statistical Analysis & Modeling:** Excel
- **Educational Content Development:** LaTeX, Microsoft PowerPoint
- **Project Management & Collaboration:** Microsoft Teams, Slack
