# Data-Teaching-Mentorship-Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to my Data Teaching and Mentorship Projects at the **American University of Technology (AUT)**! This repository showcases a collection of projects, dashboards, reports, and teaching materials from my work as a university instructor and mentor. As an educator, I guide students through complex data analysis projects, help them develop practical skills, and support their growth into capable data professionals.

## Mentorship Highlights
Throughout my teaching career, I have elevated student skills and fostered academic success through targeted guidance and hands-on learning experiences. Here are some key achievements:
- **Elevated communication, analytical, and visualization skills by 50%** through mentoring data analysis projects in business, transport, and management, utilizing Excel pivot tables to produce 7 impactful dashboards and reports.
- **Boosted student engagement by 30%** with real-world SQL exercises in Management Information Systems, achieving a 90%+ pass rate.
- **Propelled 45% of students scoring 85%+ in Probability & Statistics** by integrating data analysis methodologies, leading to an 89% pass rate.
- **Facilitated 70%+ achievement among 50% of students** in data science-related courses like Linear Algebra and Discrete Math, supporting algorithm development and problem-solving, with over 5 students securing programming jobs.
- **Achieved 50% of students earning 80%+ in Calculus III** by incorporating various analytical techniques, including data modeling like least squares regression, resulting in a 94% pass rate.
- **Attained 40% of students scoring 75%+ in Calculus & Applied Math for Business** by incorporating real-world statistical analysis problems, contributing to an 85% pass rate.

## Business Statistics

**Course Overview:**
Business Statistics at AUT covers fundamental statistical techniques with a strong emphasis on business and economic applications. The course includes topics such as data summary techniques, probability theory, probability distributions, sampling distributions, estimation, and regression analysis. Students gain skills in graphical and numerical data analysis, which are critical for interpreting and making data-driven decisions in business contexts.

**Mentoring Role:**
As the course instructor and mentor, I guide students through real-world applications of statistical concepts using projects and case studies. My mentorship focuses on enhancing analytical skills through problem-solving activities, encouraging teamwork in group discussions, and developing computer skills using tools like Excel for statistical analysis. By providing practical examples and personalized feedback, I help students connect the statistical theory to real-life business problems.

**Skills Developed:**
Students in this course develop a comprehensive set of skills, including:
- **Analytical Skills:** By solving statistical problems and engaging in case studies.
- **Teamwork and Communication:** Through group assignments and discussions, students learn to collaborate and articulate their findings effectively.
- **Technical Proficiency:** Practical use of Excel for data analysis, enabling students to apply statistical concepts to real-world datasets.
- **Critical Thinking:** Through creative problem-solving tasks, students learn to evaluate statistical information and apply it in their fields.
