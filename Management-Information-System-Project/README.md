# Management Information System Project

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between different software pricing models and user ratings using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to recommend the best BI software for various industries and business scales based on user requirements and ratings. The dataset provides insights into software categories, industries, business scales, user types, deployment methods, operating systems, and pricing models.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Data was sourced from the Software Recommendation Dataset on Kaggle, covering various aspects of BI software products.
- **Analysis Tools:** The analysis utilized Excel and SQL to explore the relationships between software ratings and key variables such as deployment methods, pricing models, and industry distribution.
- **Key Variables:**
  - **Category:** Type of BI software
  - **Industry:** Targeted industry for the software
  - **Business Scale:** Scale of business intended for the software
  - **User Type:** Intended users of the software
  - **Deployment:** Deployment model (cloud, hybrid, on-premise)
  - **Pricing:** Pricing model (freemium, open source, enterprise)
  - **Ratings:** User ratings of the software

## Key Findings
1. **Deployment Methods:** Hybrid deployment methods received the highest average ratings, indicating user preference for the flexibility of both cloud and on-premise solutions.
2. **Industry Distribution:** Manufacturing, Academia, and Utilities were among the top industries with the most software products.
3. **Business Scale Influence:** Software products for large and medium businesses received the highest ratings, suggesting a focus on scalability and features for these scales.
4. **Pricing Models:** Open Source and Enterprise pricing models were highly rated, highlighting their appeal for cost-effectiveness and flexibility.
