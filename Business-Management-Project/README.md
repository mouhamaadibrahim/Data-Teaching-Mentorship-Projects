# Business Management Project: Analysis of E-commerce Customer Behavior and Time Spending

## Major Alignment
This project is developed for students in the **Business Management Major**. It focuses on understanding customer behavior in the E-commerce sector, providing insights that are crucial for decision-making in business management. By analyzing metrics such as time spent on apps and websites, students gain practical skills in data interpretation, which are essential for enhancing customer engagement and retention strategies.

## Project Overview
This project explores customer behavior in the context of an E-commerce platform by analyzing various customer engagement metrics such as time spent on the app and website, length of membership, and annual spending. The analysis aims to provide insights into customer interactions and spending patterns, helping businesses make informed decisions to enhance customer retention and revenue growth.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes customer interaction data such as time spent on the app and website, length of membership, and annual spending.
- **Data Analysis:** Used Excel with pivot tables to perform data analysis, exploring relationships between various metrics and customer behavior.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - **Time on App:** Average time customers spend on the mobile application.
  - **Time on Website:** Average time spent on the desktop version of the site.
  - **Length of Membership:** Duration of customer membership.
  - **Yearly Amount Spent:** Total amount of money spent by customers annually.

## Key Findings
1. **Time Spent on Platforms:** Users typically spend more time on the website (peaking at 37 minutes) compared to the app (peaking at 12 minutes), suggesting different usage patterns and engagement levels.
2. **Membership Duration:** Most memberships last between 3 and 4 years, with a significant drop in retention beyond the fourth year.
3. **Spending Patterns:** A majority of customers spend between $400 and $600 annually, with spending decreasing as prices increase.
4. **Correlation Between Membership Length and Spending:** Longer memberships are associated with higher annual spending, highlighting the importance of customer retention strategies.

## Recommendations
- **Enhance Website Features:** Since users spend more time on the website, enhancing its usability and features could further increase engagement.
- **Retention Strategies:** Develop targeted retention strategies to extend customer memberships beyond four years, such as personalized offers and loyalty programs.
- **Adapt to Customer Needs:** Continuously adapt products and services to meet evolving customer needs, and monitor competitor offerings to stay competitive.
