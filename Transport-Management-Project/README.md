# Transport Management Project

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of global travel patterns, preferences, and costs using a comprehensive travel dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/traveler-trip-data/data). The dataset includes detailed information on trips, such as destinations, travel dates, trip durations, traveler demographics, and the type and cost of accommodation and transportation. The objective is to gain insights into travel behaviors and preferences, which can help travel-related businesses tailor their marketing strategies and travel packages.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured consistency in date formats and removed missing values in critical fields like trip duration, accommodation, and transportation costs.
- **Data Transformation:** Converted costs to a common currency and calculated total trip costs.
- **Data Analysis:** Explored traveler demographics, trip durations, accommodation and transportation preferences, and total costs per trip.

## Key Findings
- **Trip Duration:** Most trips last between 5 to 15 days, with a preference for week-long trips.
- **Accommodation Preferences:** Hotels are the most popular choice, followed by Airbnb, hostels, and resorts.
- **Transportation Preferences:** Planes, particularly in first class, are the most favored mode of transportation, followed by trains and other modes.
- **Cost Analysis:** Airplane travel is the most expensive transportation method, while Australia has the highest average spending across continents.

## Recommendations
- Focus on offering 7-day vacation packages as they are the most preferred.
- Maintain high standards in hotels, which are the primary accommodation choice.
- Enhance aircraft comfort to meet the needs of frequent travelers.
